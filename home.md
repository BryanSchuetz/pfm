# Domestic Revenue Mobilization

Facing limited resources, corruption, mismanagement, or other binding constraints, many developing countries are not able to fully finance vital services such as health, education, infrastructure, or citizen security. Such countries have historically turned to international donors for financial assistance to bridge this funding gap. But domestic revenue mobilization (DRM) offers an alternative way to assist developing countries.

# Revenue Administration and Management

Taxation is at the heart of the social contract: citizens pay taxes and, in return, they expect government to deliver public services. As taxation becomes more closely linked to public service delivery—and as citizens become citizen-taxpayers motivated to hold public servants to account—effective tax systems and domestic revenue mobilization measures can strengthen governance and accountability mechanisms. However, when the social contract is broken, and citizens—particularly the wealthy—are able to avoid taxes, vital services such as health and education often go underfunded, leading to a vicious cycle of underdevelopment and in many cases continuing dependency on foreign aid.

# Budget and Expenditure Management

The ability to plan and manage expenditure is integral to good governing. DAI works with national, provincial, local, and municipal governments to build their commitment and capacity to manage expenditures responsibly and effectively.
