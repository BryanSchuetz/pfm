  body: "The Assistance to Legislative Bodies of Afghanistan (ALBA) works to prepare both houses of Parliament for greater self-reliance. The program provides issue-based assistance that focuses training and capacity building on actual bills or policies that Members of Parliament (MPs) and staff are addressing. By the end of the program, our goal is for parliamentary committees to be actively reviewing legislation and conducting policy oversight as MPs increase dialogue with citizens, civil society, and media. The Parliament will create a cadre of staff able to provide regular, topical research, and legislative and budget analysis to MPs. Parliament will also provide a stronger and more consistent check on the executive branch and operate as a more independent and effective legislative, representative, and oversight body.



Sample Activities


  Provide issue-based, on-the-job training so parliamentary staff will immediately begin conducting budget analysis and legislative research themselves.
  Increase outreach work done by Parliament.
  Improve the capacity of Parliament to provide effective oversight of the executive branch.

  summary: "Though Ethiopia has achieved dramatic increases in economic growth and some successes in reducing poverty rates, the country's challenges remain substantial; gross domestic product (GDP) per capita continues to be one of the lowest in the world, revenue collection lags behind growth rates, and incentives for private sector growth are limited."
  body: "Though Ethiopia has achieved dramatic increases in economic growth and some successes in reducing poverty rates, the country’s challenges remain substantial; gross domestic product (GDP) per capita continues to be one of the lowest in the world, revenue collection lags behind growth rates, and incentives for private-sector growth are limited. Public-sector reform is challenging and the goals of the National Growth and Transformation Plan are ambitious. Success is only possible when reform is closely adapted to the local political and economic context, is well sequenced, and is Ethiopian-led.

The Tax, Audit, and Transparency Programme (TAUT) supports the Government of Ethiopia in progressively expanding the tax base and ensuring more effective tax administration. TAUT works to improve the business climate and public oversight and transparency across specific government agencies and the wider public sector.

TAUT monitors evidence that key agencies are expanding their reach and improving their effectiveness, ensuring improved revenue mobilization and more transparent and accountable services to Ethiopians.

  summary: "By 2009, years of organic and poorly planned growth in the Kingdom of Jordan had produced a large and unwieldy government bureaucracy accounting for 13 percent of the national workforce."
  body: "By 2009, years of organic and poorly planned growth in the Kingdom of Jordan had produced a large and unwieldy government bureaucracy accounting for 13 percent of the national workforce. Institutions had confusing and overlapping mandates. Public spending was rising on services that did not necessarily fall under the mandate of the public sector. At the same time, citizens struggled to find the appropriate government agencies to address their everyday needs.



Working under the U.S. Agency for International Development, DAI collaborated with a host of Jordan’s government institutions—including the Ministry of Finance, General Budget Department, line ministries, tax and customs administrations, and the prime minister’s office—to achieve fiscal reform. Building on the work of our FRP II (2009–2014) project, FRP Bridge applied a “whole-of-government” approach to foster innovative, responsive, and efficient government, whether through better provision of health care services, better targeted cash assistance to low-income populations, or simply smarter spending. Collectively, these improvements enhanced government effectiveness, improved the business environment, and created the conditions necessary to attract new investments, create jobs, spur economic growth, and improve Jordanians’ standard of living.

Sample Activities


  
    Trained government staff, with a strong emphasis on women employees, to more efficiently and effectively carry out their core functions, on topics ranging from audit techniques and use of a medium-term debt strategy tool to customs valuation.

"
  body: "Enhancing the government of Liberia’s ability to collect taxes from its citizens, known as domestic revenue mobilization (DRM), is a critical part of helping the country meet the long-term development goals laid out in its ambitious Agenda for Transformation. However, tax evasion, poor tax policy, and ineffective enforcement all constrain the government’s ability to raise the funds it needs to provide basic services to citizens and promote economic growth and social development in the country.

The Revenue Generation for Governance and Growth (RG3) project will support the Government of Liberia to confront the challenge of improving its tax collection system and cultivating a sense of accountability among taxpayers. DAI’s approach will holistically address DRM and tax system reforms. We will pair supply-side support to key government ministries, in the form of capacity building to improve policy, efficiency, and enforcement, along with demand-side interventions that increase taxpayer morale through raising awareness of taxation responsibilities, newly simplified payment methods, and the risk of enforcement for noncompliance.

However, inefficient resource management, corruption, and a lack of accountability have undermined the government’s ability to translate this economic progress into inclusive growth and improved public services for more Nigerians."
  body: "Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and one that continues to grows in size and dynamism. However, inefficient resource management, corruption, and a lack of accountability have undermined the government’s ability to translate this economic progress into inclusive growth and improved public services for more Nigerians. Advancements in public administration, public financial management, and enhanced policy making will be crucial in helping the Nigerian government provide better services to its citizen and reduce high levels of poverty.

To promote progress in these key areas, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) launched the Accountable, Responsive, and Capable Government (ARC) programme to support the Nigerian government in more effectively managing resources and providing more responsive and accountable services to its citizens. ARC will work at both the state and national levels to build on the success of its predecessor program, the State Partnership for Accountability Responsiveness and Capability (SPARC). Over seven years, SPARC helped to support responsive policy formulation and encourage performance-focused public service in Nigeria by helping state governments to improve revenue collection, reduce budgetary waste, and implement strategies for locally led planning.

In implementing ARC, DAI will take a collective action approach to reducing corruption and strengthening public accountability by working with stakeholders both inside and outside of government. ARC will also utilize Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation methods to improve public services by involving community members in identifying and solving specific issues.



Sample Activities


  Support state partners in moving to e-government services that create more secure, paperless platforms, and enhance service delivery while reducing costs.
  Strengthen capacity of Nigerian think tanks to deliver high-quality research and use results for advocacy and to contribute to the country’s current policy debates.

  body: "The Government of Guatemala’s anemic ratio of tax revenue-to-gross domestic product means the country cannot afford to provide critical public services. The project team will assist the government to increase domestic resource mobilization, enhance transparency and accountability, and support public procurement reform.

Through FPRP, DAI will assist Guatemala’s Tax and Customs Administration and Ministry of Finance to collect and spend revenue with greater efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, ultimately increasing its ability to invest in public services and improve outcomes for citizens in health, education, and economic growth.

This project will draw from similar fiscal reform successes by DAI on behalf the U.S. Agency for International Development in El Salvador, Jordan, and the Philippines.
