Taxation is at the heart of the social contract: citizens pay taxes and, in return, government delivers public services. Taxation becomes more closely linked to public service delivery—and as citizens become citizen-taxpayers and hold public servants to account—DRM strengthens governance and accountability mechanisms. When the social contract is broken and citizens, particularly the wealthy, are able to avoid taxes, vital services such as health and education go underfunded, leading to a vicious cycle of underdevelopment and in many cases continuing dependency on foreign aid. To address these capacity gaps, DAI works with clients and counterparts to improve efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection and use.

Effective tax reform and revenue policymaking requires strong technical support drafting tax laws and ensuring their consistency with the national legal system. This includes revenue strategy formulation, tax policy design, tax organization structure, and drafting of legislation needed to implement reforms.
