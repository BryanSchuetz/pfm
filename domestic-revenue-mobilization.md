title: Domestic Revenue Mobilization
---
Facing limited resources, corruption, mismanagement, or other binding constraints, many developing countries are not able to fully finance vital services such as health, education, infrastructure, or citizen security. Such countries have historically turned to international donors for financial assistance to bridge this funding gap. But domestic revenue mobilization (DRM) offers an alternative way to assist developing countries.

DRM enhances a government’s ability to generate resources to finance its operations—through taxes, fees, levies, or other public sources. In so doing, DRM builds the long-term fiscal sustainability and resilience of developing nations and empowers them with the fiscal tools to deliver improved services, now and in the future. As developing nations employ DRM tools and enhance collections, they become less reliant on outside donors or external lenders.

DAI is working with partner governments to increase their ability to collect revenue. For example, with USAID funding we are working with the Government of El Salvador to raise revenue under the Fiscal Policy and Expenditure Management Program and its predecessor, the Tax Policy and Administration Reform Program. As a result of our technical assistance, El Salvador has been able to raise an additional US$2.4 billion in revenue since 2005, increasing its tax-to-GDP ratio from 12 to 15 percent over the same period. 

> For every one dollar USAID invested, DAI delivered $63.67 of increased revenue for the Government of El Salvador—a remarkable return on investment. 

On the USAID/Philippines Facilitating Public Investment project, DAI has expanded taxpayer e-filing and supported Open Government Partnership initiatives. With our assistance, the tax-to-GDP ratio in the Philippines increased from 12.9 percent in 2013 to 14.08 percent in 2015. On the USAID/Jordan Fiscal Reform Project II, DAI contributed to an increase in tax revenues from $3.5 billion to $5.1 billion between 2009 and 2014, a 46 percent nominal increase.
