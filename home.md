## Domestic Revenue Mobilization

Due to limited resources, corruption, mismanagement, or other binding constraints, many developing countries are not able to fully finance vital services such as health, education, infrastructure, or citizen security. Such countries have historically turned to international donors for help bridging this funding gap. But, domestic resource mobilization (DRM) is an alternative way to assist developing countries to address their funding needs.

DRM is the ability of a government to collect resources to finance its operations—through taxes, fees, levies, or other sources. DRM is a way to build the long-term fiscal sustainability and resilience of developing nations and empower countries with the fiscal tools they need to deliver improved services to their citizens now and in the future. As developing nations employ DRM tools and enhance collection, they become less reliant on outside donors to finance basic services.

## Revenue Administration and Management

Taxation is at the heart of the social contract: citizens pay taxes and, in return, government delivers public services. Taxation becomes more closely linked to public service delivery—and as citizens become citizen-taxpayers and hold public servants to account—DRM strengthens governance and accountability mechanisms. When the social contract is broken and citizens, particularly the wealthy, are able to avoid taxes, vital services such as health and education go underfunded, leading to a vicious cycle of underdevelopment and in many cases continuing dependency on foreign aid. To address these capacity gaps, DAI works with clients and counterparts to improve efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection and use.

This does not usually involve increasing the tax burden for, particularly for the poor but instead seeks to improve compliance, streamlines revenue structure and management with existing policy and utilize existing resources more effectively. These feature improvements in human capacity, IT upgrades, and simplification of procedures. Projects may focus on collection enforcement, combatting tax fraud, improving transparency, or updating the legal framework.

## Budget and Expenditure Management

Integral to good governing is the ability to plan and manage expenditure.  DAI works with national, provincial, local and municipal governments to build commitment and capacity to responsible and effective expenditure management.
