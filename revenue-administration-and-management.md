title: Revenue Administration and Management

Taxation is at the heart of the social contract: citizens pay taxes and, in return, they expect government to deliver public services. As taxation becomes more closely linked to public service delivery—and as citizens become citizen-taxpayers motivated to hold public servants to account—effective tax systems and domestic revenue mobilization measures can strengthen governance and accountability mechanisms. However, when the social contract is broken, and citizens—particularly the wealthy—are able to avoid taxes, vital services such as health and education often go underfunded, leading to a vicious cycle of underdevelopment and in many cases continuing dependency on foreign aid.

To address these issues, DAI works with clients and counterparts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection and use. This process does not usually involve increasing the tax burden, particularly for the poor, but instead seeks to improve compliance, streamline the revenue structure and management within existing policy, and utilize existing resources more effectively—often by improving human capacity, upgrading information technology, and simplifying procedures. Projects may focus on enforcing collections, combatting tax fraud, improving transparency, or updating the legal framework.

Our experts have successfully implemented tax policy reform in El Salvador and Jordan and have improved in tax administration in El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Jordan, and Liberia. DAI’s expertise in this technical sector includes:
 
* VAT implementation
* Tax policy reform
* E-filling and automation of tax administration
* Improved tax audit, oversight, and compliance 
* Rationalization and reform of tax administration regulations

Effective tax reform and revenue policymaking requires strong technical support drafting tax laws and ensuring their consistency with the national legal system. This process includes revenue strategy formulation, tax policy design, tax organization structuring, and drafting of legislation needed to implement reforms.
