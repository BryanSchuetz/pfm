Integral to good governing is the ability to plan and manage expenditure.  DAI works with national, provincial, local and municipal governments to build commitment and capacity to responsible and effective expenditure management.

* Program Budgeting
* Internal controls 
* Budget execution 
* IFMIS implementation 
* Oversight and Accountability

DAI takes a holistic view of expenditure management, operating under the assumption that good planning must go hand in hand with effective internal control and efficient allocation and disbursement mechanisms. Many developing countries are in the process of automatizing the expenditure process while also implementing program budgeting. Coordinating these two major reforms requires extraordinary commitment and long term strategy for capacity building. DAI works with clients to tailor interventions to the specific needs of the institution or country while ensuring the highest quality advice and technical assistance.
