  We work to shape the debate around aid and development and influence government policy and practice. We aim to work in partnership with the UK Government to better understand how our members can deliver impact and value for money in a transparent and accountable way.

## Thought Leadership & Policy Development

  We develop policy and thought leadership publications to contribute to greater understanding of effective interventions in international development

## Public Engagement

  We work to promote greater understanding of and engagement with the work member companies do amongst the public and key influencers. We aim to address misinformation and provide accurate evidence of the impacts of UK aid and development practice.
