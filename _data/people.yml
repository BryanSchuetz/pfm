  body: "Growing up in a developing country and witnessing poverty first hand, Eunice Heredia-Ortiz always knew she wanted to help people get on the path to prosperity. Specializing in public finance, Eunice has helped governments in many countries transform their fiscal policy and management, laying the foundations for more efficient and accountable use of public resources, better public service delivery, and improved living standards.


  “Children with no clothes, no shoes, bad nutrition, and no schools … how do we empower them to have a better life? I want to dedicate my life to empowering people to prosper.” — Eunice Heredia-Ortiz


Eunice’s expertise includes improving tax policy and tax administration, public budgeting, and expenditure management, as well as designing and implementing fiscal decentralization reforms, with a particular focus on countries’ education and health sectors. At Georgia State University (GSU), she authored articles and reports on fiscal policy, tax policy, public budgeting, fiscal decentralization, education financing, and poverty reduction. She also served as a capacity-building expert for civil servants, designing curricula, delivering lectures and technical assistance, and managing the technical and administrative delivery of capacity-building programs, including GSU’s renowned Annual Public Policy Training Programs on fiscal decentralization and local governance; education policy and development; tax policy, fiscal analysis and revenue forecasting; public budgeting and fiscal management; and macroeconomic policies for economic growth.



At DAI, Eunice has helped lead U.S. Agency for International Development-funded fiscal reform projects in Bangladesh, El Salvador, and Jordan. A few examples of her latest contributions: improving transparency and accountability in Bangladesh by helping parliamentarians analyze and monitor the preparation and implementation of the national budget; enhancing public expenditure management and results-orientation in public spending in El Salvador; and identifying tax expenditures and advancing property taxation in Jordan.

  body: "After graduating from Georgetown University’s McDonough Business School, Jim Winkler accepted a two-year assignment in Costa Rica as a small business advisor with the Peace Corps rather than the well-heeled path of Wall Street and corporate America that most of his classmates followed. “I found myself working on tough, real life issues that really made a difference in people’s lives in Costa Rica,” Jim said. “I was asked to do much more in a foreign culture and language than I would have been doing in a typical career at home.”

Jim leads DAI’s Global Practice in Trade and Investment, specializing in private sector development, economic growth, competitiveness, and governance. After completing a Ph.D. at The Fletcher School, he joined DAI in 1990 and has since worked for 13 years in the head office and 14 years overseas in Bangkok, Jerusalem, Zagreb, and Hanoi. In 2004, he completed a high-profile, 18-month assessment for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on enterprise and economic growth strategies, providing a framework for a new era of development projects that integrate institutional and policy reforms with support for the private sector. He currently leads DAI’s trade portfolio of 20 projects valued at $550 million, operating in 37 countries financed by USAID, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), and the European Commission.


  “I believe we can make a big difference to improve the prosperity of people in any situation. I like taking on challenges when people say something isn’t possible. Helping Palestinian manufacturers to improve productivity and export during the Intifada, or a prime minister or minister reduce corruption and improve government services, or a trade association open up new markets for a country, these examples turn the status quo upside down for the better.” — Jim Packard Winkler


Jim has worked at the highest levels of government with cabinet-level officials and business leaders to develop innovative market and institutional reforms in each country. The creation of innovative institutions such as Paltrade in Palestine to promote trade and economic integration in the global economy and the Prime Ministers’ administrative reforms in Croatia and Vietnam required innovative design and consulting services within the political, economic, business, legal, and institutional realities of each country.

  body: "Growing up, Lara Goldmark was asked so often whether she wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer that she chose neither. Instilled with a global outlook by her French mother, Lara knew from an early age that she wanted to pursue an international career. After earning a degree in political science, her fluency in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese helped her get a job organizing an HIV/AIDS conference in Latin America for the Pan American Health Organization. Lara’s first field experience was in Limón, Costa Rica, working in a shelter for street kids. When she first flew back to the United States, she still remembers seeing the world through the kids’ eyes, how colorful the Miami airport looked and how many rich gringos there were.

Lara later worked with the Inter-American Development Bank’s Microenterprise Unit, launching her career in finance for the disadvantaged. She consulted and designed loan packages for microfinance institutions, savings cooperatives, and agriculture stakeholders in Central America, Haiti, and Brazil. After joining DAI, Lara worked four years in Brazil, leading a microfinance strengthening program for Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social. While in Brazil she founded a DAI subsidiary, DAI Brasil, that offered consulting services to Brazilian banks, international donors, and private companies engaged in corporate social responsibility initiatives. She later led the Improving the Business Climate in Morocco project, where she studied derija, the Moroccan dialect of Arabic.

During a period away from DAI, Lara worked on a shared value consulting project with  mining company in Peru, reviewing their social investments and proposing a multi-stakeholder water clean up strategy that was approved by the CEO for Latin America. She then spent three years at FHI 360, building the international workforce practice and leading a global research and training program called Workforce Connections.

Lara now leads DAI’s Economic Growth portfolio, the largest in the company and the heartland of our work. She oversees a team of specialists organized into five practices: financial services, agriculture and agribusiness, trade and competitiveness, workforce development, and business environment reform. “I came back because this is a company that believes in me and the work that I do,” she said, “and that keeps me growing professionally.”
