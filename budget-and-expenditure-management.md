The ability to plan and manage expenditure is integral to good governing. DAI works with national, provincial, local, and municipal governments to build their commitment and capacity to manage expenditures responsibly and effectively.

DAI takes a holistic view of expenditure management, reasoning that good planning must go hand in hand with effective internal controls and efficient allocation and disbursement mechanisms. Many developing countries are in the process of automating the expenditure process while also implementing program budgeting. Coordinating these two major reforms requires extraordinary commitment and a long-term strategy for capacity building.
