title: Domestic Revenue Mobilization
---
Due to limited resources, corruption, mismanagement, or other binding constraints, many developing countries are not able to fully finance vital services such as health, education, infrastructure, or citizen security. Such countries have historically turned to international donors for help bridging this funding gap. But, domestic resource mobilization (DRM) is an alternative way to assist developing countries to address their funding needs.

DRM is the ability of a government to collect resources to finance its operations—through taxes, fees, levies, or other sources. DRM is a way to build the long-term fiscal sustainability and resilience of developing nations and empower countries with the fiscal tools they need to deliver improved services to their citizens now and in the future. As developing nations employ DRM tools and enhance collection, they become less reliant on outside donors to finance basic services.

DAI is working with partner governments to increase their ability to collect revenue. For example, through USAID funding, we are working with the Government of El Salvador to raise revenue under the [Fiscal Policy and Expenditure Management Program and predecessor Tax Policy and Administration Reform Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-fiscal-policy-and-expenditure-management-program-fpemp). As a result of our technical assistance, the Government of El Salvador has been able to raise an additional $2.4 billion in revenue since 2005. This is reflected in the increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio from 12 to 15 percent in the same time period. 

> For every one dollar USAID invested, DAI delivered $63.67 of increased revenue for the Government of El Salvador – this is a remarkable return on investment.  

On the [USAID/Philippines Facilitating Public Investment project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-facilitating-public-investment-fpi), DAI has expanded taxpayer e-filing and supported Open Government Partnership initiatives. With our assistance, the tax-to-GDP ratio in the Philippines increased from 12.9 percent in 2013 to 14.08 percent in 2015. 

On the [USAID/Jordan Fiscal Reform Project II](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/jordan-fiscal-reform-project-ii-and-bridge-activity-frp-ii-frp-bridge), DAI assistance contributed to an increase in tax revenues from US$3.5 billion to US$5.1 billion from 2009 to 2014, a 46 percent nominal increase.
